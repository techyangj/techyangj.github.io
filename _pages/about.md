I am Yangyang Jiang(蒋洋洋). I am a Master's student in Communication and Information Systems at Shanghai University. Prior to this, I completed my B.E. in Engineering in Electronic Information Science and Technology at Henan University.


Research Interests
======
My research focuses on federated learning, IoT security, and blockchain security. 

- Trusted Machine Learning: Dedicated to the research of poisoning defense and verifiable research.
- Blockchain security: Smart contract auditing is an important step to ensure the security of contract code. Auditing includes static code analysis, dynamic analysis, symbolic execution and other technologies, aiming to discover potential vulnerabilities in the contract.

As you can seen, those topics are all about computer security.

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position whose research aligns with these interests. If you are looking for a dedicated and passionate student to join your research group, please consider my application.
