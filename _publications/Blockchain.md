The blockchain has gained widespread attention due to its decentralized, secure, traceable, and immutable characteristics. However, current consensus protocols face the challenge of limited scalability and inadequate consideration of dynamic node behavior in large-scale networks. They cannot effectively adapt to the increasing number of nodes and the subsequent network traffic surge. Furthermore, their inability to sufficiently address dynamic node behavior poses a risk to the consensus process and compromises the overall reliability of the system. A cluster reputation-based hierarchical consensus model (CRHCM) has been proposed to addresses node dynamics and improves network scalability in this paper. The model introduces a reputation system that updates node reputations based on both current and historical behaviors during the consensus process. Node reputation fluctuations are assessed using a discrete Markov chain, which enables the identification of abnormal nodes and improves overall node reliability. Furthermore, a hierarchical structure has been proposed to improve scalability and reduce the communication complexity of blockchain by assigning nodes to the upper or lower layers through reputation and fluctuation levels. Experimental and theoretical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CRHCM. The model achieves a balanced distribution of reputation values among all nodes and exhibits high scalability. It has excellent performance by comparisons with some other state-of-the-arts.
